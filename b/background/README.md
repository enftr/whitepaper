The United African Metaverse started as a web 2.0 Defi and Play-to-earn gaming platform (enftr.io) which has features such as NFT Marketplace, Decentralized exchange, collection of P2E, L2E games etc. Late 2021 into 2022 saw the emergence of the metaverse on a global scale and once the worldwide audience got used to the paradigm it became imperative that enftr.io metamorphosize into ENVerse (United African Metaverse) In order to embrace the global change with a focus on the African niche driving adoption of the Metaverse through entertainment (Movies, Music and Games), Education, Healthcare & wellness and FinTech in Africa.
