# Governance & DAO

The ENVerse ecosystem will be guided by a number of policies which shall be debated and voted upon by the ENDAO.\


The ENDAO is the decentralized autonomous organization that will be responsible for the governance of the ENVerse ecosystem. Some of the responsibilities of the ENDAO includes:

* Approving upgrades within the ecosystem
* Adjusting parameter within the ecosystem
* Submitting improvement proposals and debating their merits
* Arbitrating disputes derived from the usage of the DAO managed infrastructures
* Determining the long term roadmap of the ecosystem
* Calibrating the value capture mechanisms of the ecosystem

Some of the set tools of the ENDAO's full functionality includes:

* The governance token - ENN Token which is the governance token of the DAO and most notably is required by the DAO members in order to cast their votes
* Voting contracts - This is a smart contract that coordinates an on-chain token weighted vote on a proposal that must meet the pre-defined threshold and quorum by ENDAO members or ENDAO delegates in order to be approved
* Discussion forum
* Delegation systems
