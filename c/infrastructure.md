# Infrastructure

ENVerse is being built with a robust tech-stack powered by various technologies such as Blockchain, AR/VR, Artificial Intelligence, 3D reconstruction and Internet of things (IOT). There is a seamless integration through all layers of developments i.e. Blockchain layer, AR/VR layer, Artificial intelligence layer, 3D reconstruction layer, Identity & authorization layer and the payment layer.

### The Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer plays a crucial role in the ENVerse metaverse from providing a decentralized infrastructure to supporting the development of powerful use cases for the ecosystem.\
The blockchain layer provides the ecosystem with unique features such as:

1. High transaction speed
2. Low transaction cost
3. Interoperability
4. Efficiency and sustainability
5. Distributed storage
6. Security

### AR/VR Layer

Users are able to access ENVerse through everyday devices like PC and smart phones or through augmented reality and virtual reality glasses. \
Augmented and virtual reality technologies facilitates the immersive experiences and the more engaging three-dimensional virtual world of ENVerse. Some of the AR/VR tech-stack that is being used in the development of ENVerse includes:

* Unreal Engine
* AR toolkit
* Google AR core
* Apple AR kit
* MAXT AR

### Artificial Intelligence Layer

The artificial intelligence layer is an important layer powering ENVerse development, AI integration replaces human activities with computer-controlled automated actions, making avatar movements realistic, language processing easy and helps the metaverse to build automated assistance to respond to the user's queries. Avatars are created using MetaHumans, Ready Player Me and other avatar creators. Some of the AI tech-stack employed includes:

* AWS sage maker
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn

### 3D Reconstruction Layer

Realistic virtual spaces on ENVerse is being built using 3D reconstruction technologies these includes creation of photo-realistic objects like buildings, the high definition 3D environment and other physical locations inside ENVerse metaverse.\
Unreal engine and Blender are some of the 3D tools that are being employed.

### Identity & Authorization

ENVerse aims to provide security as well as ease of access to it's users. They are able to utilize traditional Web 2.0 login e.g. Facebook, Google and Emails etc. or use wallet log in such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet etc.

### Payments

Secure and seamless payment is an essential part of any transaction, ENVerse shall provide onramp/off-ramp support through strategic payment gateways and channel partners. ENVerse understands the use of payments across Africa therefore we shall be partnering with region specific payment providers across Africa to ensure a familiar transaction experience to end users.
