### Seed Round

Seed round investors will have 5% token allocation of the total 5 Billion token supply at the price of $0.0030 and a seed valuation of $15,000,000 brings the seed raise to $750,000. Seed tokens shall be vested with a 1 year cliff period, M13 = 10%, M18 = 10%, M24 = 20%, M30-M39 = 60%

### Private Round

Private round investors will be allocated 12% of the total $ENN token supply at a price of $0.0040 and a valuation of $20,000,000 bringing the raise value to $2,400,000. Private round tokens will be cliffed to M12 and vested through M30.

### Pre IDO

Pre IDO investors will be allocated 2.5% of the total $ENN token supply at a price of $0.0048 and a valuation of $24,000,000 with a raise value of $600,000. Pre IDO tokens will be cliffed till M5, 10% at M6, 90% linearly distributed through M11.

### Public

Public round tokens will be 0.5% of the total $ENN token supply at a price of $0.0050 and a valuation $25,000,000 brings total valuation to $25,000,000 with an initial market cap excluding liquidity at $127,500.00. The public token shall be vested with 10% released at TGE, 1 month cliff, 1.5% daily vesting till 90%.

### Team & Advisor

The team and advisor token will be 15% of the total $ENN token supply. The team and advisor token will be cliffed till M23, 10% released at M24, 90% linearly distributed through M60.

### Liquidity

A good tokenomics and ecosystem relies on liquidity to give the token it's value, We will be allocating 4% of the total $ENN token supply to the liquidity pool, 20% released at TGE and 80% daily vesting through M26.

### Ecosystem

We understand the essence of the ecosystem and community, we prioritize giving power to the community. We therefore allocate 42% of the total $ENN token supply to the ecosystem fund which will include rewards, staking rewards, marketing, and future developments. 4% of the ecosystem token will be available at TGE with 96% linearly distributed through M2 to M61.

### Treasury

18% of the total $ENN token supply will be locked in the treasury, tentatively the treasury is set out to be able to support the token price by implementing some price support mechanisms such as 10% initial burn at TGE.

Some of the tokenomics vesting/allocation schedule may change if the ENDAO votes otherwise.
